## Main Branch
Develop

## Getting Started
For our application we use Angular as frontend and Java Spring Boot with mySql as backend. We also make use of Maven for our backend.  
The database we use is mySql. For the backend to work, you need to alter the database properties in the file 'application.properties' with your own. Such as DBUSER, DBPASSWORD and DBNAME.

You can run the application as follows: 
- Open a terminal in the folder 'frontend' and run 'ng serve'. 
- Open a terminal in the folder 'backend' and run 'mvn spring-boot:run'. 
- Open a browser and navigate to 'http://localhost:4200/'.
