# LEAP-webapp
Leap webapp is a project by students from AP Hogeschool for AP Hogeschool.

## Main Branch
Develop

## Getting Started
For our application we use Angular as frontend and Java Spring Boot combined with MySQL as backend in a Maven project.
For the backend to work, you need to alter the database properties in the file 'application.properties' with your own. Such as DBUSER, DBPASSWORD and DBNAME.

You can run the application as follows: 
- Open a terminal in the folder 'frontend' and run 'npm install' followed by 'ng serve'. 
- Open a terminal in the folder 'backend' and run 'mvn spring-boot:run'. 
- Open a browser and navigate to 'http://localhost:4200/'.
