# Backend
The backend of this project is made with Java Spring Boot.

## To-Do
* Decide if we will use JWT or not (Authorization class still exists, would have to redo the custom authentication module)
* Change company to work with a ENUM of countries
* Test user admin registration as this failed in the past but got fixed, not tested yet.
